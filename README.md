Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) is a technology that uses radio waves to detect, locate, and track objects in the surrounding environment. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including aviation, meteorology, military applications, navigation, and automotive safety.
Radar systems work on the principle of transmitting electromagnetic waves and analysing the echoes received from objects. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, radar can determine the distance, speed, direction, and other characteristics of the detected objects.
